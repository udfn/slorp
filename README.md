# Slorp!
Slorp is a simple box selection and screenshotting tool for your Wayland compositor (so long as it supports the wlr layer shell and screencopy or ext-image-copy-capture protocols).
Slorp is heavily inspired by [slurp](https://github.com/emersion/slurp/) with even some code taken from it, thanks! Slorp is not quite yet a full drop-in replacement though.

## Usage
Simply check out `slorp -h`. Works best when used with scripts.

## Build
It's Meson, with reasonable dependencies. nwl must be a subproject, though.

## Todo
Lots :) But this is mostly good enough for me for now.
